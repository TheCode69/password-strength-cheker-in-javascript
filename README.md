# password-strength-cheker-in-javascript
The provided JavaScript code is a function named checkPassword. Its purpose is to assess the strength of a password based on its length and provide corresponding feedback. Here's a breakdown of the logic without the specific code lines:

Function Definition:
The code defines a function called checkPassword that takes a password as a parameter.

Element Retrieval:
The function fetches an HTML element with the ID "checkPass". This element serves as the location where the password strength message will be displayed.

Password Strength Checking:
The function evaluates the provided password based on its length.

Empty Password:
If the password is empty, it sets the text content of the "checkPass" element to "Type Your Password".

Weak Password:
If the password has a length less than 8 characters, it sets the text content of the "checkPass" element to "Weak Password".

Strong Password:
If the password has a length of 8 characters or more, it sets the text content of the "checkPass" element to "Strong Password".

By employing this function alongside an HTML password input field, users can receive immediate feedback about the strength of the password they enter. The message displayed dynamically changes as the user types, providing real-time guidance.
